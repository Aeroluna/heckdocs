# User Shared Environments

After creating a custom environment, they can be turned into a shareable standalone JSON that can be used on any map like the override environment option. These JSONs must be placed in `Beat Saber/UserData/Chroma/Environments/` and must have the file extension `.dat`. These files will be loaded when you launch Beat Saber and will produce errors in your log when any fail to load.

!!! tip
    You can also manually reload the files without restarting Beat Saber if you are in Debug Mode (launch parameter `-aerolunaisthebestmodder`) by pressing `Ctrl+E`.

## Finding Custom Chroma Environments

Other user's environments can be found in the heck discord in the #environments channel, feel free to share your own in there as well!
